import java.lang.ref.Reference;

/**
 * References provides two key helper methods for commonly used idioms on ref types:
 * {@link #isCleared(Reference)}, and {@link #isReferringTo(Reference, Object)}.
 * <p>
 * Both of these idioms are obviously trivially implementable using {@link Reference#get()}.
 * However, such explicit implementations produce a temporary strong reference to
 * the referent, forcing a "strengthening" of the referent when performed during
 * concurrent marking phases on most concurrent collectors (such as G1, C4, ZGC,
 * Shenandoah, etc.). By capturing the non-reference-escaping semantic definitions
 * of these idioms, JDKs may validly intrisify their implementations to perform
 * the required logic without strengthening the referent.
 * <p>
 * Various uses of {@link Reference} subclasses can use these method idioms when
 * performing the common operations needed to maintain various data structures such
 * and weakly keyed maps, lists, etc., without those operations explicitly
 * force-strengthening referents. When run on JDKs that intrisify these implementations,
 * or on future JDKs that would provide similar functionality (and to which this class
 * will adapt in a portable way), such strengthening will be avoided.
 * <p>
 * For example, the JDK's own internal {@code WeakIdentityHashMap} implementation could,
 * when using these two methods, have it's get() and set() methods work without requiring
 * the force-strengthening of unrelated keys and without forcing unrelated entries and
 * values to stay alive.
 * <p>
 * Since JDKs may choose to "intrinsify" the implementation of the methods in
 * this class, no assumptions, beyond those provided in the documentation below,
 * should be made about their actual implementation.
